I wanted to summarize what we discussed in our conversation yesterday: - When users are not logged in, there will only be one Postcards page. It will just be labeled "Postcards" but it will be the Grade 2 set. SSS-Please give me details hows you want
display grades 2 set design.Designs already approved. On the Postcard detail pages, users will be able to read up until the beginning of the Ideas section. Then an Overlay will prompt people to Log in or Sign up. (see sketch) SSS- On detail page you want
login and signup button. - See attached sketch. This Overlay should use same graphic language that has already been developed for pop-ups. SSS- I think its just another login sketch on details page. - When users are logged in, the Postcards section will
show the grades for which they have signed up, including all the ideas without any overlay. SSS- Please elaborate more if some one have subscrived two grades then he will se two menus. - See the attached image of how Medium adds and overlay on top of
their content to get people to sign up. SSS-Please explain. Sign up Form - I'm not sure if it is developed enough yet for me to get a sense of how it will work, but I'm not getting a clear idea of how I'll be able to modify it in your backend. Is something
that could be managed in Contentful instead of in your system? SSS- Signup form developed by our system. so you can add fields in signup form by login admin pannel. - As you know, I wanted it to be editable by me in the back end. To start out with, I'd
like it to be much shorter than the long list of all possible fields. See attached sketch for edited number of fields, all combined into one screen to be more user-friendly. SSS-Approved design we have developed into our system. For another approached
we will take more time. - A couple of the utility dialogs don't seem in keeping with the rest of the graphics - I've noted them on the attached. - Will Account Info be modifiable when they are logged in? SSS- What info you want to modifiable. Email and
name will be permanent user can not modify it.They can change passward on clicking forget passward. In addition: - Can you please make the body copy a bit smaller and track in the letter spacing? SSS-Please explain. Designer will do it . - We also discussed
a while back controlling the webpages from Contentful by defining the modules that we're using on the site. I know you said I would need to contact you to get the website to look for new pages, but I'm wondering if I can set them up to be mostly ready
to go before I ping you. Attached is an inventory of the web modules we're using so far (Page banner; Slider; Staggered; etc). Would it be possible to put those in Contentful as options, from which I can build new pages?
